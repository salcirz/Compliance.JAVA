// This is a program I created to find a funds non compliant positions! it works by scanning the securities document while saving and sorting its positions over 5% of its 
fund. The great thing about it is that it works if a company is invested in multiple different tikers but the same company, ex Google Inc GOOG and GOOGL. It then 
adds these values to a master excel sheet that I formatted.I added the two excel sheets that I used to the repository and also a screenshot of what it would look like
to utilize this program!
